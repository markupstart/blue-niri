# blue-niri

Started with base-main:latest then added Niri, some bluefin branding (i.e Wallpapers), some DX elements (docker, virt-manager, vscode) along with a few things to run niri effectively (thunar, fuzzel, xwayland-satellite, tuigreet, etc). Things are not configured totally out of the box and is for personal use and as always a work-in-progress).

sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/markupstart/bluefin-niri:latest

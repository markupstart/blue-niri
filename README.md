# Blue-Niri

Started with Base-Main:Latest then added Niri, some bluefin branding (i.e Wallpapers), some DX elements (docker, virt-manager, vscode) along with a few things to run niri effectively (Thunar, Fuzzel, xwayland-satellite, tuigreet, etc). Things are not configured totally out of the box and is for personal use).

sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/markupstart/bluefin-niri:latest
